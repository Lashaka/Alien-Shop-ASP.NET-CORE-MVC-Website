# Alien-Shop-ASP.NET-CORE-MVC-Website
Welcome to Alien-Shop, an ASP.NET Core MVC Website for managing a catalog of aliens. This website features a clean and user-friendly interface that allows you to view the catalog of aliens and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the aliens in the catalog through the admin panel.

## Getting Started
To get started with Alien-Shop, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. After cloning the repository, you will need to set up the database using SQL server.
Once the database is set up, go to the `appsettings.json` and change the `DefaultConnection` to your local DB.
then you can run the website and access the home page, catalog page, and admin panel through the navigation menu.

## Pages
### Home
The home page serves as the landing page of the website, where you can quickly get an overview of the aliens in the catalog.

### Catalog
The catalog page displays the full list of aliens in the catalog. Here, you can view the details of each alien, including its name, description, and image.

### Admin
The admin panel is where you can perform CRUD operations on the aliens in the catalog. With the admin panel, you can add new aliens, edit existing aliens, and delete aliens as needed.
